# HTTP File Downloader (TCP Example)

This application downloads a file from an HTTP server (developer.mbed.org) and looks for a specific string in that file.

This example is implemented as a logic class (HelloHTTP) wrapping a TCP socket. The logic class handles all events, leaving the main loop to just check if the process has finished.

## Pre-requisites

To build and run this example the following requirements are necessary:

* A computer with the following software installed:
	* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/download/).
	* [yotta](https://github.com/ARMmbed/yotta). Please note that **yotta has its own set of dependencies**, listed in the [installation instructions](http://armmbed.github.io/yotta/#installing-on-windows).
	* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
	* [ARM GCC toolchain](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded).
	* A serial terminal emulator (e.g. screen, pySerial, cu).
	* Optionally, for debugging, pyOCD (can be installed using Python's [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)).
* An FRDM-K64F development board.
* An Ethernet connection to the internet.
* An Ethernet cable.
* A micro-USB cable.
* If your OS is Windows, please follow the installation instructions [for the serial port driver](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration).

## Known Issues
There are two known issues with this example:
* Dangling connections. If a connection is left unterminated, such as if the target mbed-enabled board is reset before it completes the example, the server will recognize the new connection as a repeated packet from the old connection and ignore it.  This is caused by the TCP quad (src IP/port, dest IP/port) and sequence number being identical.
* Ignored new connections. A server may recognize a repeated connection as a retransmission even after a completed TCP close. This occurs when the example has run successfully one time, then is run again by resetting the target mbed-enabled board. This is caused by the TCP quad (src IP/port, dest IP/port) and sequence number being identical.

It is possible to work around this problem by changing the source port number using bind.

## Getting started

1. Connect the FRDM-K64F to the internet using the Ethernet cable.

2. Connect the FRDM-K64F to the computer with the micro-USB cable, being careful to use the micro-USB port labeled "OpenSDA".

3. Navigate to the root mbed-example-network directory that came with your release and open a terminal.

4. Set the yotta target:

	```
	yotta target frdm-k64f-gcc
	```

5. Build the examples. This will take a long time if it is the first time that the examples have been built:

    ```
    $ yt build
    ```

6. Copy `build/frdm-k64f-gcc/test/mbed-example-network-test-helloworld-tcpclient.bin` to your mbed board and wait until the LED next to the USB port stops blinking.

7. Start the serial terminal emulator and connect to the virtual serial port presented by FRDM-K64F. For settings, use 115200 baud, 8N1, no flow control.

8. Press the reset button on the board.

9. The output in the terminal window should look like:

    ```
    TCP client IP Address is 192.168.2.2
    Connecting to developer.mbed.org:80
    HTTP: Received 552 chars from server

    ```
## Using a debugger

Optionally, connect using a debugger to set breakpoints and follow program flow. Proceed normally up to and including step 5 (building the example), then:

1. yotta debug mbed-example-network-test-helloworld-tcpclient

    The output should look like this:

    ```
    info: found mbed-example-network-test-helloworld-tcpclient at test/mbed-example-network-test-helloworld-tcpclient
    info: preparing PyOCD gdbserver...
    info: finding connected board...

    (gdb)
    ```

2. Start a terminal emulator and connect to the virtual serial port presented by the FRDM-K64F at 115200, 8N1.

3. Load the program

    ```
    (gdb) load
    ```

4. Once the program has loaded, start it.

    ```
    (gdb) c
    ```

5. The output in the serial terminal window should look like in step 9 above (the final step of the regular run).
